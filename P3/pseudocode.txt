Indexing
////Create term-symptom index and sympDict and termDict////
1. Read sym_t.csv file
	For each line
	1.1. Tokenize to sid and title
	1.2. Add sid and title to sympDict
	1.3. Tokenize title
		For each token
		1.3.1. Add token to termDict and increment term counter
		1.3.2. Create posting from tid to sid
2. Create termPostingDict
3. Write termPostings to termCorpus.index file
4. Write sympDict to symptom.dict file
5. Write termDict to term.dict file
6. Write termPostingDict to termPosting.dict file

////Create diagDict////
7. Read dia_t.csv file
	For each line
	7.1. Tokenize to did and title
	7.2. Add did and title to diagDict
8. Write diagDict to diagnosis.dict file

////Create symptom-diagnose index and diagnose-symptom index////
9. Read diffsydiw file
	For each line
	9.1. Tokenize to sid and did (dump weight for now)
	9.2. Create sympPostings from sid to did
	9.3. Create diagPostings from did to sid
10. Create sympPostingDict
11. Create diagPostingDict
12. Write sympPosting to sympCorpus.index file
13. Write diagPosting to diagCorpus.index file
14. Write sympPostingDict to sympPosting.dict file
15. Write diagPostingDict to diagPosting.dict file
